\caption{The fractional uncertainties (68\% confidence level) at $Q^2 = 10^4 \, \textrm{GeV}^2$ of the EPPS21 global determination of nuclear PDFs (red),
specifically of the set with $A=184$ (tungsten target), 
compared to the results of profiling with the FASER$\nu$2 DIS projections.
The impact of the baseline LHC neutrino dataset, 
consisting of the FASER$\nu$2 experiment inclusive and charm structure functions and charge flavour separation,
assuming statistical errors only (blue), 
is compared to the case accounting for both statistical and systematic uncertainties (green).
